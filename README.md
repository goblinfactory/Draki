### Simple and rapid critical path smoke testing for web apps

*Make it so easy to write a functional smoke test for your web application that there's no excuse not to!*

*Smoke testing library with a deliberately simple API that does not allow you to test functionality that you should only be testing by using a javascript testing framework. (e.g. complex mouse movements)*

*This is the test framework that every manager should insist their dev team use. Rapidly get broad (critical paths) tested and baked into your CICD, and don't get bogged down in detail, leave that to the Angular devs and to Jasmin [and other test tools](https://medium.com/powtoon-engineering/a-complete-guide-to-testing-javascript-in-2017-a217b4cd5a2a).*

## Getting started

#### 1) have a discussion with client and collect some written requirements  of the most critical workflows of your system you need to urgently test

Get this down in writing in any written form that allows you to include the requirements as part of your source code. 
Example below is one common style of writing requirements. It is just a plain markdown text file with our requirments written loosly in [Gherkin syntax](http://docs.behat.org/en/v2.5/guides/1.gherkin.html). You can use plain english, it really does not matter.

> :: `outstanding-balance.requirement.md`

Scenario outline : customer with outstanding balance cannot close their account

> Given a customer with an `@outstandingBalance` has just logged in with valid credentials<br/>
> then the customer should be on the 'my-account' page<br/>
> and the close account button should be styled with the `@appropriate` style. <br/>
> When the customers tries to close his account by clicking the close account button<br/>
> Then the customer `@shouldSeeWarning` message his account cannot be closed <br/>
> And the customer `@shouldSeeReason` why the account cannot be closed<br/>

Examples:

outstanding balance | appropriate style | should see warning | should see reason
--- | --- | --- | ---
100 | close-denied | yes | yes
0 | close-ok | no | no



#### 2) install draki test package in your test project

> install package draki 

***Draki package is not currently available yet!*** I'm busy working on this ...this very instant. If you want to be notified as soon as the package is pushed to nuget and available to test drive, please ping me a message on twitter [@snowcode](https://www.twitter.com/snowcode)

#### 3) Initialising the test engine

```csharp
[SetUpFixture]
public class RunOnceBeforeAllTests
{
    [OneTimeSetUp]
    public void Setup(){

        Config.WaitUntilTimeout(TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(1000));
        SeleniumWebDriver.Bootstrap(SeleniumWebDriver.Browser.Chrome);
    }
}
```

#### 4) Write some test classes

```csharp

public class RootPage {
    public cost string Url = "http://localhost:12345";
}

public class LoginPage {
    
    public const string Login = RootPage.Url + "/Login";
    public const string UserNameSelector = "#name-control";
    public const string UserPasswordSelector = "#password-control";
    public const string LoginButtonSelector = "#login-button";
}

public class MyTestBase : FluentTest
{
    public void GivenIamLoggedIn(TestUser user){
        I.Open(Pages.Login);
        I.Expect.Text("Welcome to the login page").In("h1.page_title");
        I.Enter(user.Name).In(LoginPage.UserNameSelector);
        I.Enter(user.Password).In(LoginPage.UserPasswordSelector);
        I.Click(LoginPage.LoginButtonSelector);

        // for our demo purposes we are pretending all pages have a hidden loginstatus `div`
        // also using I.Expect in the inside lambda, so that if the login fails, 
        // and test that has a precondition for the user to be logged in will not fail, instead
        // will Assert.Inconclusive() which is what we want. 

        I.WaitUntil(()=> I.Expect.Text("logged-in").In("div.loginstatus"), TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3));
    }
}
```

#### 5) Write some tests that test the system as described step by step in your requirements

This is very rough pseudo code, but I trust you get the GIST! If you have any questions, please contact me on twitter [@snowcode](https://twitter.com/snowcode)

```csharp

public class AccountTests : MyTestBase
{
    [Test]
    [TestCase(100.00M, "close-denied", true, true)]
    [TestCase(0M, "close-ok", false, false)]
    public void customer_with_outstanding_balance_cannot_close_their_account(decimal outstandingbalance, string appropriateStyle, bool shouldSeeWarning, bool shouldSeeReason)
    {
        // Given a customer with an `@outstandingBalance` has just logged in with valid credentials
        var user = TestData.LoadTemporaryTestUser(outstandingBalance);
        this.GivenIAmLoggedIn(user);

        // then the customer should be on the 'my-account' page
        I.Assert.Text("MY ACCOUNT").In(AccountsPage.AccountHeadingSelector);

        // and the close account button should be styled with the `@appropriate` style.
         I.Assert.Class(appropriateStyle).On(AccountsPage.CloseAccountButton);
        
        // When the customers tries to close his account by clicking the close account button
        I.Click(AccountsPage.CloseAccountButton);

        I.WaitUntil(()=> {

            // Then the customer `@shouldSeeWarning` message his account cannot be closed
            I.Assert.Css("visibility",shouldSeeWarning ? "visible" : "hidden").On(AccountsPage.WarningMessage);

            // And the customer `@shouldSeeReason` why the account cannot be closed
            I.Assert.Css("visibility",shouldSeeReason ? "visible" : "hidden").On(AccountsPage.ReasonMessage);

        }, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10))
    }
}
```

#### 6) If you want you can read the temporary docs

[temporary API documentation for Draki (FluentAutomation)](/Docs/)

#### WOOT! your're done early! Now go home early and fire up the barbi!

some good housekeeping below...

#### Test code notes

1. In the demo above I've highlighted a common difficulty with automated testing, how do you repeatedly run a test against a live system without having to constantly reload your entire repository, e.g. your sql database?
1. The solution is not to hard code specific test users, but rather create new random test users specifically for each test, otherwise there is a risk that some badly written test can interfere with this test, e.g. `add balance, and close account` test would kill this test if the db changes were not rolled back.
1. If your `TestData` helper class can access an in memory test database proxy, that's also an excellent testing parttern.
1. Running tests against uniquely created users means you don't have to worry about parallel tests interfering with each other.
1. It's ok to open a page that may have data that's changing as a result of other tests, as long as you consider this and what you're actually testing, the 'xpath selectors' your're executing are working on DOM elements that you know will be consistent.

#### 7) Bake in a good habit of always checking your preconditions using `I.Expect`

Remember to always use positive confirmation to check your precondiions using the `I.Expect` fluid syntax

- any precoditions that fail will throw an `Assert.Inconclusive` and not a `Fail`, so that you can quickly hone in on the actual code changes to your system that has caused the tests to fail, instead of suddenly seeing hundreds of tests fail.

#### 8) Now that you're familiar with the basics it's time to kick this party up a notch!

Run your tests simultaneously in both Firefox and Chrome and IE and record screenshots of any errors along the way:

```csharp
// Multi-provider sample coming soon...
```

### Building the solution and running the unit tests

1. run `update-chrome-driver.ps1` to download and unpack (unzip) the latest chrome driver.
1. build the solution
1. right click on the test project `FluentAutomation.TestApplication` and select `View -> in browser`. This will start iisexpress.
1. Run or debug any unit test you want to.

### how is this different from FluentAutomation?

* Draki is a derived clone of [FluentAutomation](https://github.com/stirno/FluentAutomation) with some updated drivers and simplified tests so that it can be more easily kept up to date with Selenium changes.
* Mostly what this boiled down to is removing all the API calls that worked with the mouse X and Y position or used relative X and Y physical pixel offsets anywhere. These are the parts that result in brittle tests that break if a div changes size or position by a few pixels, updating drivers, switching from xunit to nunit and writing some documentation.
* I'm hoping FluentAutomation will become more actively developed again and I can eventually replace my reliance on this project with FluentAutomation again, however I urgently need the testing features for a project that relies on the FluentAutomation syntax, and FluentAutomation is currently broken and not actively being developed. (last commit > 2 years ago.)
* result is much smaller code base
* The added benefit of the reduced API is a longer 'shelf life' between each package release before any update of Chrome or Selenium causes one of the API's on the test library to fail and require a new nuget release. 
* The aim is to be able to automate the testing of new Chrome packages, and immediately (automatically) bring out a new nuget package if an update to Selenium passes all tests, without human intervention.
